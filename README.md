This project is a compatible ATX-Extension for the JetKVM.
I created it by reverse engineering the original one and creating my own version of it.

The software is tested 100% working.
The circuit is currently not tested and should only be used as a guide to how create your own. For what I know it should work, but I'm not an engineer.

Everything you do or build is at your own risk, I'm not liable for any damage that could happen to your JetKVM or PC.
